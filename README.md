# r2-streamer-swift

## Install dependencies

The project dependencies are managed with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
You need to run `carthage update --platform ios` to fetch the dependencies and build their frameworks.

## TODO

- Add a target for an iOS framework
- Make it a carthage module
- Handle unexploded EPUBs
